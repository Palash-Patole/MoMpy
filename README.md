# MoMpy
Mayonnaise on Mars: Python (MoMPy)* is a Python-based toolbox under development that can be used to solve various astrodynamics and space mission geometry problems. Refer to the wiki for more information on the features available.


\* The name of the project is inspired by a term used in the video installation - What the Heart Wants - by a Belgian-American artist Cécile B. Evans. I was fortunate to witness this intriguing piece of artwork, unlike anything that I had seen before, when it was exhibited at the Gallerie d'Italia in Milan during July 2019.
